            <p>Greetings ,</p>
            <br />
            <p>Let me give you a brief overview before we expand the conversation.</p>
            <p>
                I'm a Research Assistant in the Research and Development Department, Select Pharma Laboratories Ltd, One of the leading
                Bio-Pharmaceutical Companies in the UK.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm looking for a reliable person in your region to represent my company in sourcing some of the basic raw materials
                (Gedoroxin Herbal Extract G 55)used in the manufacturing of high-quality Anti-Viral Vaccines, Cancer treatments, and
                other lifesaving Pharmaceutical Products.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This may not be your specialization but it will definitely be another income-generating business out of your field.
                Since we lost the last supplier due to health complications my company procurement department has not signed a new
                contract with any supplier to order the material, however, I was able to discover a local dealer that can supply this
                product. He sells at a cheap rate, which is far cheaper than our previous purchases.
            </p>
            <p>The director of procurement is not aware that I have found a new seller.</p>
            <p>
                I want you to stand in as a new local dealer from your country which will make it easier for me to introduce you to the
                director of procurement. The reason is I do not want my company to have direct contact with this local agent that sells
                the herbal oil extract at a very low price. There is nothing illegal about this business. Being the company research
                assistant and monthly salary earner, this is how we make extra income.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You and I will work together as partners and make really good profits from the supply. I will guide and direct you on
                the process that will facilitate the award and signing of the supply contract for you. Moreover, the cheaper price you
                will give my company will get the attention of the chief procurement officer to buy from you, therefore there are
                chances you will get the contract.
            </p>
            
            <p>If you are interested to proceed I will give you more specific profit details when I receive feedback from you.</p>
            
            <p>Regards</p>
            <p>---</p>
