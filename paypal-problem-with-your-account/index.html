            <p>Dear Paypal User,</p>
        
            <p>Today we had some trouble with one of our computer systems. While the trouble appears to be minor, we are not
                taking any chances. We decided to take the troubled system offline and replace it with a new system.
                Unfortunately this caused us to lose some member data. Please follow the link below and log into your account to
                make sure your information is not affected. Account balances have not been affected.</p>
        
            <p>Because of the inconvenience this causes we are giving all users that repair their missing data their next two
                incoming transfers for free! You will pay no fees for your next two incoming transfers*.</p>

            <p>Thank you for using PayPal!</p>
        
            <p>* - If fees would normally apply, you will not pay anything for the next two incoming transfers you receive.</p>
