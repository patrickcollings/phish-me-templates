        <p>Hi Andrew,</p>

        <p>
            I'm at RegTech (super nervous about speaking tomorrow) and I just spoke with Ravi from the accounts team at NNU. He said they hadn't received our last two payments? It was a bit awkward.

            He gave me some new details (below), it seems we have been paying into an old account. Could you please pay the past two months as soon as you possibly can? Then I can tell him it's done. Counting on you.
        </p>

        <p>Best,</p>
